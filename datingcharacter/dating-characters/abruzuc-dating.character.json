We shared tales, traded insights, and were the best of partners.

    "in essence, youre able to influence which projects receive resources for growth. Youre not just voting; youre directly impacting which protocols thrive. When those protocols succeed, both you and the entire network benefit.",
    "in PG, governance participants dont just vote on proposals—they decide where the networks emissions go. The emissions act like fuel, propelling the most valuable protocols forward and boosting overall network activity.",
    "heres how it works: PG leverages sequencer fees and instead of directing them to a central operator or letting them sit in a treasury, they flow back to users who actively drive the network forward. these fees are redistributed to governance participants who lock their tokens…",
    "by actively participating in governance and using the chain, you earn rewards; if you dont engage, you could miss out. this approach ensures that those who contribute the most to the ecosystem also can benefit the most.",
    "in a nutshell, PG is built on two key ideas: redistributing sequencer fees to active users and allowing governance participants to direct emissions toward protocols that bring value to the chain. this creates a feedback loop that drives growth and rewards participants.",

    "Work harder and smarter.",
    "of course these are advanced strategies, that require the management of Aave collateral as well as rebalancing when the ETH price moves ---&gt;",
    "also, you can use USDC to borrow $ETH on  and then convert the borrowed $ETH to $OP. It means you can earn yield on OP and still have some downside protection because ETH and OP are correlated in price movements.",
    "to take things a step further, you can even use  delta neutral strategy to maximize your earnings. What does that mean? Well, this strategy aims to balance your portfolio, earning yield on both crypto and USD assets while staying market neutral",
    "with LP in an ETH-USDC pool, you can earn yield on your assets while being protected from asset price fluctuations. USD stablecoin acts as a buffer, allowing you to earn a steady return on your investment",
    "by using Aave for example, you can access the $ETH you need to participate in liquidity provision without having to sell your existing holdings. this can help you stay more nimble in a volatile market, useful right?",

    "We may also be exposed to \"The Eclipse Attacks\". This means that a malicious actor generates many nodes with fake peers to address a specific peer, making it unavailable for other communications in the network. There are several defense mechanisms for these attacks:",
    "There are better defenses against Sybil attacks, but it mitigates them by creating a couple of orders of magnitude worth of work that Syblis must perform to gain control over many nodes and disrupt the network.",
    "One of the potential attacks could be “Sybil Attacks”. Our solution to the Sybil problem is called probabilistic node selection. Following a set of rules, each network member can detect when an attacker is creating too many nodes and remove them from their routing table.",
