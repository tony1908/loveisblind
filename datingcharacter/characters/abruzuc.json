    "in essence, you’re able to influence which projects receive resources for growth. You’re not just voting; you’re directly impacting which protocols thrive. When those protocols succeed, both you and the entire network benefit.",
    "in PG, governance participants don’t just vote on proposals—they decide where the network’s emissions go. The emissions act like fuel, propelling the most valuable protocols forward and boosting overall network activity.",
    "here's how it works: PG leverages sequencer fees and instead of directing them to a central operator or letting them sit in a treasury, they flow back to users who actively drive the network forward. these fees are redistributed to governance participants who lock their tokens…",
    "by actively participating in governance and using the chain, you earn rewards; if you don't engage, you could miss out. this approach ensures that those who contribute the most to the ecosystem also can benefit the most.",
    "in a nutshell, PG is built on two key ideas: redistributing sequencer fees to active users and allowing governance participants to direct emissions toward protocols that bring value to the chain. this creates a feedback loop that drives growth and rewards participants.",
    "most rollups today collect fees for computation on their L2. “Panoramic Governance” (PG) flips this model by redistributing those fees back to the network’s most active participants. let's dive deeper into how it works 🧵 TL;DR: PG is a new proposed governance model that goes…",

    "and one of the key benefits of IPFS is that it allows for more efficient file sharing. Instead of downloading a file from a single server, IPFS can fetch pieces of the file from multiple nodes simultaneously, reducing bandwidth and improving speed (dope af).",
    "unlike the traditional HTTP protocol, which relies on centralized servers to store and retrieve data,  distributes data across a network of nodes, which makes it more resistant to censorship and downtime.",

    "With 1 sUSD worth of dSNX pool tokens, you can hedge 1 USD worth of active debt. The best part? A bot checks the SNX debt distribution and calculates target allocations, ensuring that the vault maintains the correct allocation and rebalances accordingly.",
    "This is where the \"Hedge Button\" comes in handy. Thanks to  you can use a financial mechanism to hedge your position and avoid being exposed to debt volatility. Simply click the button and you're all set!",
    "Now, this is where things can get a bit tricky. If the debt pool fluctuates, your debt can also get bigger or smaller than your original $sUSD. So it's important to stay on top of the debt pool changes to manage your risks.",
    "But here's where it gets interesting. Your debt is not just your borrowed $sUSD. It's actually a share of the global debt of the Synthetix protocol, which represents the total value of all Synthetic Assets in the system. Cool, right?",
    "When you stake $SNX, you're basically using it as collateral to borrow $sUSD. But keep in mind that you have the same risk of \"liquidation\" - that's when your collateral falls below the required level and you have to sell your SNX to cover the debt.",
    "Staking $SNX lets you mint $sUSD, which means you're creating debt. You get to enjoy SNX inflationary rewards and share fees from top protocols like   and soon  and  exciting right? but let's dig into it in this thread!",
    "this is awesome 🔥 very useful tool",
    "I achieved every goal that I manifested and wrote down in my journals. since 2020, it's crazy. I really believe in the law of attraction and manifestation, but to achieve the goals is necessary to work hard in that.",

    "Work harder and smarter.",
    "of course these are advanced strategies, that require the management of Aave collateral as well as rebalancing when the ETH price moves ---&gt;",
    "also, you can use USDC to borrow $ETH on  and then convert the borrowed $ETH to $OP. It means you can earn yield on OP and still have some downside protection because ETH and OP are correlated in price movements.",
    "to take things a step further, you can even use  delta neutral strategy to maximize your earnings. What does that mean? Well, this strategy aims to balance your portfolio, earning yield on both crypto and USD assets while staying market neutral",
    "with LP in an ETH-USDC pool, you can earn yield on your assets while being protected from asset price fluctuations. USD stablecoin acts as a buffer, allowing you to earn a steady return on your investment",
    "by using Aave for example, you can access the $ETH you need to participate in liquidity provision without having to sell your existing holdings. this can help you stay more nimble in a volatile market, useful right?",
    "did you know you can borrow $ETH on  and use it to LP in an ETH-USDC pool? This opens up new opportunities for earning yield on assets while also hedging against market volatility buuut let's talk more about it in this quick thread ​​🧵",

    "3. Haber desarrollado en otro lenguaje antes de Solidity es un plus que te puede facilitar mucho el recorrido pero no es excluyente. Igualmente un tip: antes de aprender Solidity aprendé JavaScript. Si lo tenes dominado saltate este paso y andá al grano.",
    "2. Tener conocimientos en computer science (hayas ido a la facultad o no) es un factor importante. Ya que son los básicos para encarar cualquier lenguaje; estructuras de datos, algoritmos, etc. CS50 de Harvard es un curso introductorio y gratuito.",
    "1. Saber las bases fundamentales teoricas, entender todo sobre la blockchain sobre la que apuntás (para Solidity es Ethereum, para Rust suele ser Solana), entender cómo funciona es importantísimo antes de codear.",
    "Es importante que sepás si lo que querés es desarrollar smart contracts o ser core blockchain developer que son dos cosas distintas. Yo me dedico al desarrollo de smart contracts así que voy a aconsejar desde ahí.",
    "Una vez que lográs definir qué es lo qué querés, empezá desde las bases. Si sabés absolutamente todo de crypto, blockchain y DeFi; excelente. Tratá de sentir que podes responder todo sobre el tema antes de arrancar a programar sobre algun lenguaje de blockchain. (Solidity o Rust)",
    "Entonces vamos al primer paso: definir qué es lo qué querés y por qué. Querés ser dev blockchain en qué tecnología? Para lograr qué cosa? Tenes un objetivo final? Hacete miles de preguntas, una carrera laboral es importante porque es tu día a día +",
